## To be continue
The project was creared in order to play around with Animated and PanResponder API, but now I am eager to make it look complete, so some next steps are: 
* Functionality of creating word decks instead of having one static
* Adding tests as another way of revising material
* Light / dark theme
* Better design + app icon
